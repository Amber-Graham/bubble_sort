# bubble_sort
bubble sorting method using Ruby for TOP

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This was a fairly straight forward
project. I was able to learn about other
methods that would be better for this than
the #bubble_sort method. 

I learned about "Big-O Notation", which is a 
way to measure an algorithm's efficiency.
Essentially, if we look at worst case
scenarios...#bubble_sort is one of the 
least efficient ways to go. It has a 
worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2).
This means the efficiency actually decreases
as the number of elements grow. Yikes!

I traveled back in time and learned about
asymptotes...never thought I would see or hear
that word again after high school!

All in all, #bubble_sort is a fun name, but
doesn't hit high on performance or efficiency.
